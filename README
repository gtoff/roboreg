This project requires Salt version 2016.3. The non-API parts should work with the older 2014.1.

Launch in the following order (on separate terminals):
 $ ./launch-salt-master.sh
 $ ./launch-salt-minion.sh
 $ salt-key -c config --accept $HOSTNAME
 $ ./launch-salt-roscommand.sh # for testing

To make use of the Roboreg registry, launch in addition:
 $ ./launch-salt-api.sh
 $ ./api-call-http.sh # for testing
 $ ./roboreg

The output of Roboreg is as follows:
 Robot ecrp / t=1465385020 / h=adbbc3 [  *]
       ^name  ^timestamp     ^hash    ^liveliness
